# FRAIR v0.4.1

## Model / numerical changes
- Moved to the 'lamW' package for lambertW estimation. 
	- This should improve performance.  
	- This drops the dependancy on 'emdbook', which in turn drops the dependancy on 'rgl' which requires X11 on MacOS.  

- Changes to the Beddington-DeAngelis Type-II model 
	- What had been advertised as the Beddington-DeAngelis Type-II in FRAIR (the `bdII*` family) in versions prior to 0.4.1 was not correctly specified. 
	- The code used for these functions was taken directly from Bolker 2008 (Ecological Models and Data in R). This model includes a fixed term `P` which only "partitions" the fitted coefficients between multiple predators.
	- The original functions are now fully deprecated and removed from FRAIR. Trying to use them will throw an error. 
	- The original code is now available as `emdII`. Hopefully this name better reflects it's heritage. 

- Changes to the real77 and real77r Models
    - Prior to version 0.4.1 the `real77* family were internally consistent, but not terribly well specified. It is probable that the old specification made curves very hard to fit and generated non-sensical 'q' parameters. 
    - The real77* family have now been fully deprecated and removed from FRAIR. Trying to use them will throw an error.  
    - More sensible "flexible exponent" model specifications (`flexp` and `flexpnr`) have been added as a replacement. 

- Changes to the hassIIIr model
    - Nothing substantive has changed internally, however this model is now called `hassIIInr`, which better reflects that it is a '**n**on-**r**eplacement' model.  
    - Attempting to use a `hassIIIr*` function directly will pass through gracefully to `hassIIInr`, with a warning.
    - That said, `hassIIIr` is no longer recognised by `frair_responses()` so attempting to fit this model within the FRAIR framework will throw an error.  
	
## Code and backend changes
- Most "external" functions are called through explicit reference to the package (via '::'). Hopefully this makes it easier for someone else to take over in the future.  
- When the `tozero` argument of `lines.frfit`, `lines.frboot` and `drawpoly.frboot` is TRUE, these functions try to plot to zero. If that would cause an undefined value for the fitted response, then it draws to 1e-04 instead and a warning is thrown. Note that this does not guarantee all bootstrapped fits will be defined at this value either. 
- All of the internal `get` calls are scoped to 'package:frair'. This means it is now not possible (whether accidentally or deliberately) to 'overwrite' FRAIR functions with those in the global namespace. This functionality might return in the future alongside some formal documentation for extending FRAIR. 
- Minor changes to `print.frboot` removing an unnecessary extra line break. Yep. Big stuff! 

## Temporary changes
- The call to `boot` **does not** use `::`.  The reason is that in the (fairly likely) scenario that users go digging into the structure of the frboot objects and call `obj$fit` directly, the `boot::boot` in the call confuses `print.boot` and it reports some pretty crazy stuff!
