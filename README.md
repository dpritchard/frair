# frair

A package for functional response analysis.  

This code is developed by former members of the Functional Response Analysis group at [Queen's University Belfast][qub] and maintained by [Daniel Pritchard][dp]

## Installation
The "stable" version of FRAIR can be installed from CRAN.

devtools::install_github('dpritchard/frair')
library(frair)
````
