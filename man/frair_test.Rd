\title{Test for evidence of type-II or type-III functional responses}
\description{Implements the phenomenological test of type-II vs. type-III functional responses described by Juliano (2001)}

\usage{
frair_test(formula, data)
\method{print}{frtest}(x, \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{formula }{A simple formula of the form \code{y ~ x}.}
  \item{data }{The dataframe containing \code{x} and \code{y}.}
  \item{x }{Output from \code{frair_test}.}
  \item{\dots }{Other items passed to the print method.}
}

\details{
This function wraps up an otherwise trivial test for type-II \emph{vs.} type-III functional responses in a format consistent with the FRAIR syntax. It can be considered 'phenomenological' inasmuch as it tells the user if a type-II or type-III response is preferred, but not what form that curve should take nor if it is sensible to fit such a curve via non-linear regression.  

The test relies on the established principle that a logistic regression on the \emph{proportion} of prey consumed is a more sensitive test of functional response shape, especially at low prey densities, when a non-linear curve may not be able to distinguish the subtle difference in curve shape. 

The logic follows that on the proportion scale, a type-II response will show an increasing (\emph{i.e.} positive and statistically different from zero) initial slope with respect to density whereas a type-III response will show a negative slope, followed by a positive higher order slope 

The test proceeds by fitting two models:

\code{glm(cbind(eaten,noteaten)~density, family='binomial')}

\code{glm(cbind(eaten,noteaten)~density+density^2, family='binomial')}

where \code{eaten} is the lefthand side of the \code{formula} input, \code{density} is the righthand side and \code{noteaten} is the difference between the two. The output from these models to determine which functional response is preferred using the logic above.

Currently no consideration is given to a type-I (\emph{i.e.} linear) response or any other potentially sensible fit other than a type-II or type-III response. It is up to the user to decide if it is appropriate to continue with fitting a mechanistic model of the functional response (\emph{i.e.} \code{\link{frair_test}}, \code{\link{frair_compare}} and/or \code{\link{frair_boot}}) on the back of the results of this test.
