Kia ora / Hello from New Zealand.  

## Bug update
This is a bug-fix and maintenance release for FRAIR.  
All of the relevant changes (both user-facing, and back-end) are documented in NEWS.md

## Test environments
- Local OS X (El Capitan, v. 10.11.4): R 3.2.4
- Win-Builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
This package still has no downstream dependancies, nor am I expecting there to be very many (if any) in the foreseeable future!
